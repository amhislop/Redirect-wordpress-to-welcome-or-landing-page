# What

Easy simple to the point plug-in allow you to set URL so users get redirected to it if they landed on your home page or any page or post.

When the users come back to your website again they will see the normal home page again as the redirection happens only one time per user.

Your visitors will be redirected to the set URL if it is the first time they visit your website and for X days, hours or minutes (you set the number in the configration) if they visit again within the time they will not be redirected again.

# You can use this plugin for:

- Collect emails from users who visits your site.
